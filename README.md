Quick Unreal Tournament 2004 Executer

This program made it easier to use Unreal Tournament 2004 in a psychological laboratory setting by providing a way to execute a series of hard-coded individual and team-based server instances.

The UTQC (Unreal Tourmanet Quick Connect) program was then used by participants to quickly connect to the current individual or team-based game.

Because the games settings were hard coded, this code is unlikely to be useful except for a record of what was done and for examples of server settings.
